{"issue":"Redo Overview Page","body":"I don't think the overview page is especially useful right now. When people start using Collabbit more seriously, I think it's going to be very important for them to see new comments on their updates, new comments on updates they've commented on, and maybe a few other similar kinds of information. I think that alerts about this kind of stuff are exactly what the overview page should be. I think the point of the overview page should be to get you up to speed very quickly on everything that's happened since you were last logged on (or maybe just everything that's happened recently).\n\nThese are the things that I think the overview page should do:\n\n* Show incidents that have changed (closed, created, new updates)\n* Show comments on updates the user has created\n* Show comments on updates the user has commented on\n\nI don't think it should show a list of all of the incidents, which is what it's doing right now, and I think incidents should be ordered by the last time they were changed rather than by when they were created. We've talked about how the incidents/index page is basically just duplicating the functionality of the overview page before, and most of our discussion has focused on either getting rid of the incidents page or making *it* more useful. I think we should focus on the overview page instead: it's what everyone sees when they first log in to Collabbit, and I don't think it's particularly useful right now.\n\nThoughts?","labels":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/collabbit/collabbit/labels/eli","name":"eli","color":"ed96f5"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/collabbit/collabbit/labels/NeedAnswer","name":"NeedAnswer","color":"f7820d"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/collabbit/collabbit/labels/sam","name":"sam","color":"3c6ca6"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/collabbit/collabbit/labels/will","name":"will","color":"e6d87c"}]}

Someone who's not afraid of technology should be able to take five minutes, read this stuff, and jump right in. Should explain the *reason* for the feature rather than just explaining the feature too. (Example: contacts are there to make it easy to find people the right people to talk to.)\n\n* explain what contacts are\n* explain what groups are\n* explain what incidents and updates are\n* explain how notifications (texts/emails) work\n\n#### Tutorials\nEither video or text + images (both would probably be good), these are for people who want step-by-step instructions on how to use Collabbit.\n\n* how to join groups\n* how to add an update\n* how to filter updates/contacts (and do interesting things with that, like send a mass email)\n\n\nAnything else we're likely to need?

{"issue":"length of comments on updates","body":"Comments on updates for all updates page should be expandable at a reasonable length, like the updates themselves are (with an add \"more\" option). While comments can be really long (filling the height of the browser), they do seem to be limited in length, but there is no indication of this to the user. If the comment is too long it simply just doesn't post, and there's no error message. ","labels":[]}
{"issue":"my groups filtering broken","body":"SearchLogic is doing something wrong with groups filtering for both users and updates.\n\nRight now the condition we're using is something like this:\n\n    :groups_id_equals_any => [1,2,...]\n\nIf a user is a member of multiple groups (say, 1 and 2) then it returns multiple copies of that user. So for the default demo data we get results like this in script/console:\n\n    >> Instance.first.users.groups_id_equals_any([1,2,3]).size\n    => 6\n    >> Instance.first.users.groups_id_equals_any([1,2,3]).uniq.size\n    => 2\n\n(Instance.first is the demo instance, and both John Smith/Jane Smith are members of the first three groups.)\n\nThis seems to be a SearchLogic issue. I'd guess that the problem is that we're comparing multiple to multiple and SearchLogic is getting confused. I'm reporting it as a SearchLogic bug (http://github.com/binarylogic/searchlogic/issues/issue/102).","labels":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/collabbit/collabbit/labels/sam","name":"sam","color":"3c6ca6"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/collabbit/collabbit/labels/v1%20fixes","name":"v1 fixes","color":"a60c0c"}]}

I would imagine cherry picking it here until we base our impl to this repo will be impossible.\r\n\r\nBut the fix is to put `\"use strict\";` as the first line inside the `define()` function in the file its complaining about. Then F5 run client.html and go fix the place, chrome dev tools will give you exact like by clicking the error. Note that not all strict mode errors happen during file parsing. So for some things you actually have to execute the function to get the strict mode error to dev tools.\r\n\r\nAs said I have gone through the codebase to make jsdoc work, for file parsing and execution. @cvetan5 can go though my commits and port the changes manually.\r\n\r\nFinally test with `grunt doc` that it completes without errors.\r\n\r\n![image 1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/157519/12167796/fb6c7824-b536-11e5-8e01-56e5fcac650a.png)\r\n","labels":[]}

{"issue":"THREE.SkinnedMesh loading support to dev2","body":"I think we should support skinned skeletal animated meshes out of the box.\r\n\r\nIn Ogre-Tundra EC_Mesh supports them so that there is a separate skeleton ref attribute which makes sense as Ogre's skel anims are in separate files.\r\n\r\nWith Three.js however the skeleton and animations are in the same JSON with the geom. But different code is needed to handle them: static meshes with plain `Mesh` and animated with `SkinnedMesh`.\r\n\r\nIn WebTundra 1.0 (master now) the EC_Mesh implementation supports that by detecting  whether the geometry has bones or not, and chooses Mesh or SkinnedMesh based on that. That code is in: https://github.com/realXtend/WebTundra/blob/master/src/view/ThreeView.js#L286\r\n\r\nI propose the same for 2.x (in dev2 now). I think the place to port that bones check code is: https://github.com/realXtend/WebTundra/blob/dev2/src/view/threejs/asset/ThreeJsonAsset.js#L147\r\n\r\nInterestingly the clone() method there already has this kind of check: https://github.com/realXtend/WebTundra/blob/dev2/src/view/threejs/asset/ThreeJsonAsset.js#L110\r\n\r\nI wonder when that hits if the loading code never creates SkinnedMesh?\r\n\r\nMade a test case for this first using the deer from lvm / chesapeake bay:\r\nsource: https://github.com/playsign/webtundra-deer\r\ndemo: http://playsign.github.io/webtundra-deer/\r\n\r\nThe code there is simply: \r\n`var deer = this._createMesh(\"Deer\", \"webtundra://White_Tailed_Deer_all.json\");`\r\n\r\nNow it shows both without skinning and for some reason also without the correct materials (with col and spec map textures).\r\n\r\nThe desired result with using Three.js SkinnedMesh directly is:\r\ndemo: https://antont.github.io/three.js/examples/webgl_animation_skinning-deer.html\r\ncode: https://github.com/antont/three.js/blob/example_skinning_deer/examples/webgl_animation_skinning-deer.html#L91\r\n\r\nSo unless there are objections I'll give a shot at modifying `ThreeJsonAsset.js` to do the same automatically (apart from starting the anim).","labels":[]}

Thus much of the EC impl is dealing with loading those other files and applying them etc.\r\n\r\nIf we recommend use of Three assets, and don't even have the Ogre asset loading available, one way would be indeed to just remove those parts that overwrite the loaded material now. But that may make things difficult for where Ogre assets are used so perhaps what's needed is to make `EC_Mesh_ThreeJs` somehow work for both cases: not overwrite with default white when the mesh already has the correct material.\r\n\r\nI'll check if can do that next but am open for other ideas too. If this one EC impl becomes too complex while handling both cases, perhaps the Ogre things could be moved to some `EC_Mesh_ThreeJsFromOgreAssets` class or so. But perhaps a simple check for existing material does it simply enough.\r\n\r\nAlso, the animation data seemed to be lost somewhere -- am not sure if that's due to the ancient three.js in dev2 still (r62 vs 72dev with which have tested the deer export now otherwise) or if something in the loading & ec mechanism still overrides that.","labels":[]}

Making a mental note here to fix it later. Also asking for input from @cadaver as you know the sync manager code best and authored Entity parenting.\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce**\r\n\r\n1. Login to a server with a client.\r\n2. Create two Entities.\r\n3. Parent the smaller id Entity to the bigger entity Id. (eg. Entity #1 to Entity #2).\r\n4. Logout and login back.\r\n5. You should see a warning on the console (client side) `Failed to find parent Entity #2 for Entity`\r\n\r\nI looked at the code of the SyncManager server state processing. It looks like the initial scene sync is done in the order of creation (essentially ascending by id). This is not good enough anymore as we have parenting. The result on the client is that scene struct and actually even the code `Entity::Parent()` will lie to the user. The parents creation is not monitored if it fails to be found during creation. I think this is good because we dont want the mess/complexity of `EC_Placeable::parentRef` monitoring.\r\n\r\n**Proposed solution**\r\n\r\nIt's quite simple really if I'm not missing something. Don't send the new Entity messages while processing the state (looping dirty new ents). Instead make a list and insert each item to the correct place as per parenting hierarchy. It might be even faster to create two lists, one for root Entities and after those Entities that have children. Then a secondary list that has any parented Entities.\r\n\r\nAfter all new ents have been processed, loop the list (or the two lists) and send them to the client in the correct order.\r\n\r\n@cadaver I see that the initial sync is the only place where problems might occur would you agree? Do you see any problems coming from changing the order of initial sync entities?\r\n\r\n**Edit:** If you save the scene after pareting to txml/tbin Restart the server with that scene description, it will get fixed. Thanks to the proper hierarchy in the scene descs now, the parent will always get created before the children. Hence getting a smaller id and getting added to the client states prior to the children. I think this is even the case (order of the client sync state) even if new ids are not generated for the scene as the CreateEntity is emitted first for the parent, but I didnt check.","labels":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/realXtend/tundra/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"e10c02"}]}

{"issue":"Simplify component construction","body":"Recently there was some changes that made it possible to create components with a null scene to the constructor. I think before it we didn't have this problem and they were always created to a owning scene. This was a good change, we no longer need a dummy scene to put stuff into for inspection etc. Afaik this feature is mostly used when you drag and drop a .txml into Tundra and want a UI preview without actually adding it to the active scene yet. (This is what I know happens, not sure if it was the reasoning to allow creating components this way).\r\n\r\nAnyhow, now we have a slight problem that has been going on for a while. Components that are not being maintained that well or by programmer error are crashing on this kind of creation. The feature is rarely used so it goes unnoticed untill someone does a .txml import like this.\r\n\r\nIf you use the ctor given `Scene*` or `Framework*` in the ctor youll get a crash like this. We have pretty much fixed all current components (just fixed couple ones in core and meshmoon today), but this makes writing components hard. Having to know to check for null ptrs.\r\n\r\nAlso sometimes choosing the logic to be done in ctor or handing it during component lifetime and on the `ParentEntitySet` signal is tricky. It is not well known to even me if `ParentEntitySet` signal is emitted **before** `AttributeChanged()` is invoked for the first time with the initial attribute values. So lets say that you want to make a `AssetRefListener` that gets used in `AttributeChanged`, but you only want to do that allocation if you are on a non-headless Tundra instance. As the framework cannot be reliably used in the ctor, you move the headless check and allocation into a slot connected to `ParentEntitySet` signal. Now, is your ref listener still null when you are handling the first value of your asset ref attribute in `AttributeChanged()`? Or maybe I want to do certain allocations only on a server instance?\r\n\r\nThis kind of confusion makes it harder to write components. If I cant figure out the order quickly, I would think more novice Tundra users will have immense problems following the initialization logic/order of a component.\r\n\r\nHence I propose that all component ctors should get a valid `Framework*` into them, that should be passed to the `IComponent` ctor and be set to the `framework` (currently set from the scene ptr, and left null if that is null) member variable. This way only thing that you need to be aware is if the scene is null. This change should not break anything as nothing but the component factories \"new\" up components. Framework could be passed to the factories to be used on component creation.\r\n\r\nWe should also document if the `ParentEntitySet` signal is guaranteed to be emitted before `AttributesChanged()` is invoked.\r\n\r\n(Another option suggested by @Stinkfist0 would be to have `Initialize()` function you can override that will get called once when everything is in order.)\r\n\r\n**TL;DR** We need to change so that framework ptr is always valid in component constructors.","labels":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/realXtend/tundra/labels/Feature%20Request","name":"Feature Request","color":"02d7e1"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/realXtend/tundra/labels/Refactoring/Redesign","name":"Refactoring/Redesign","color":"e11d24"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/realXtend/tundra/labels/Research","name":"Research","color":"FF6A00"}]}

{"issue":"Change KarafTestContainer to rely directly on options and KarafPropertiesFile","body":"Please do not merge this pull request yet.\r\n\r\nI've created it as entry point for discussion about Pax Exam options used by Karaf test container. In few places we have commas which are simply separators for properties like boot features, repositories and so on. Because of that in many places we need to keep these \",\" and have values prepended by it. This causes small, but additional effort in test code.\r\n\r\nTo avoid string glue for boot features and repositories I prepared additional options:\r\n- **KarafBootFeatureOption**\r\n- **KarafFeatureRepositoryOption**\r\n\r\nThese options allows to extend bootFeatures and featureRepositories properties in org.apache.karaf.features.cfg file.\r\n\r\nAdditional option introduced by this commit is **LogCategoryLevelOption** which allows to specify log4j.logger.<category> property inside org.ops4j.pax.logging.cfg.\r\n\r\nDuring my work on these options I've found that lots of options are handled in manual way - ie. each config option has corresponding method in KarafTestContainer. Amount of code duplicated or very similar there is terrifying.

{"issue":"[WIP] Reset dataset programatically","body":"This introduces an API feature which allows the user to reset, refresh or setReadOffset on the dataset both from the handlebars template, as well as from a controller / route. \r\nFixes #34\r\n\r\n> Note: This PR only provides an API to set the readOffset on the dataset explicitly. In order to reset all fetched records in the dataset, I refer you to https://github.com/thefrontside/ember-impagination/issues/34#issuecomment-169219312. \r\nTLDR: If you want to fully reset the `impagination-dataset` to an empty state, you have to pass it a new `fetch` function.\r\n\r\nReasons for resetting or refreshing a dataset:\r\n\r\n1. Since the dataset only resets when `{{impagination-dataset}}` parameters change, there is no clear way to reset the dataset. When we want to fetch data from the backend with a query which does not rerender the route, we must manually fire a dataset reset/refresh.\r\n\r\n2. To comply with a planned feature to filter-records on the frontend, we will want to manually refresh the dataset to apply filters on records which may have changed. Since filtering data on the frontend does not rerender the route, we must manually fire a reset/refresh.\r\n\r\nNew API features:\r\n``` javascript\r\nactions: {\r\n  reset: function()    // sets the dataset to readOffset `0`\r\n  refresh: function() // sets the dataset to the currentReadOffset\r\n  setReadOffset: function(offset) // sets the dataset to passed-in `offset`\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Refreshing Dataset Examples\r\nIn this example we refresh the dataset upon updated search queries through the `{{search-pane}}` component.\r\n\r\n#### from child components\r\n\r\n```hbs\r\n{{#impagination-dataset fetch=myFetch as |dataset|}}\r\n  {{#search-pane search=(action \"performSearch\") on-search-results=(action \"reset\" target=dataset)}}\r\n      {{#ember-collection items=dataset as |record|}}\r\n        {{chat-search-result result=record}}\r\n      {{/ember-collection}}\r\n  {{/search-pane}}\r\n{{/impagination-dataset}}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### from parent route\r\nWe use the `on-observe` action, which fires whenever there exists a new dataset to observe. We can then perform actions on the new dataset, which are PASSED-UP TO THE ROUTE, along with the dataset.\r\n\r\n```hbs\r\n{{#impagination-dataset fetch=myFetch on-observe=(action \"observeDataset\") as |dataset|}}\r\n  {{#search-pane search=(action \"performSearch\")}}\r\n      {{#ember-collection items=dataset as |record|}}\r\n        {{chat-search-result result=record}}\r\n      {{/ember-collection}}\r\n  {{/search-pane}}\r\n{{/impagination-dataset}}\r\n```\r\n\r\n``` javascript\r\n    observeDataset: function(dataset, actions) { // dataset and actions are passed-up\r\n        this.set('dataset', dataset);\r\n        this.set('actions', actions);\r\n    },\r\n   _refreshDataset() {\r\n        let refresh = this.get('actions.refresh');\r\n        refresh.call(this.get('dataset'))\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nTODO / WIP:\r\n- [x] refresh should fire the observer\r\n- [x] setReadOffset must fire observer when we pass-in the current `readOffset` of the dataset\r\n- [ ] Write tests for firing actions from child components","labels":[]}

{"issue":"Fork consolidation","body":"First off: Big \"thank you\" for working on this nice package. We're using it in Bookyt with great success:-)\r\n\r\nThere's a couple of forks out there, each providing some missing support or fixing some issues. My branch at https://github.com/CyTeam/mt940_parser is among those. I just got a [PR by @alexanderadam](https://github.com/CyTeam/mt940_parser/pull/2) fixing an issue with some banks.\r\n\r\nNow, I'd like to have this fix upstream, in a released version.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately when I needed the library it failed to parse the files I had and I found out that it was a bit too opinionated about some fields. @tom025 had a [nice branch ](https://github.com/LyagushkaLimited/mt940_parser)with some changes that worked for me. But they are a bit intrusive, so simply merging is not possible.\r\n\r\nI went through the changes again to see if we could get the branches merged again. Here's a list of the relevant changes:\r\n* introduce rspec unit tests\r\n* Add OpeningBalance\r\n* Change meaning of\r\n** 25/Account\r\n** 28/Statement\r\n** 68/StatementLineInformation\r\nThe other changes are mostly non-functional and could be ignored IMHO.\r\n\r\nI think adding the OpeningBalance is a no-brainer, just needs to be ported.\r\n\r\nThe additional specs seem to be nice, but could well be ported to test-unit. They also mostly tackle the changed classes for 25,28,68. Which brings us to the most tricky part:\r\n\r\nThe classes for Account, Statement, StatementLineInformation are more opiniated regarding content of the fields than the MT940 spec describes. They parse implementation specific fields. @tom025 therefore deprecates and replaces them with implementations that are closer to the standard. He delegates unknown methods back to the old implementations, but with a deprecation warning.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned your gem failed on my files because it expected non-standard field formats. Therefore I really would like to see the changes in this area integrated.\r\n\r\nQuestion: would you accept PRs that supersede the mentioned classes with new implementations as visible in our branch at https://github.com/CyTeam/mt940_parser?","labels":[]}

{"issue":"BEMTREE вместо BEMJSON по умолчанию","body":"С этой проблемой столкнулся лично я. С одной стороны выглядит безумием, а с другой оправданно. \r\n\r\nКогда я начинал своё знакомство, то городил длиннющий `bemjson`. Это ад! Я проклинал БЭМ, но верил в него. Городил различные `require` для подставки кусков bemjson. Кто работал с большим количеством уровне вложенности блоков, тот поймёт. Это страшно. Затем начинает болеть голова... Как ЭТО ВСЁ ВНЕДРИТЬ В ПРОЕКТ, как это вообще можно контролировать, ГДЕ ХВАЛЁННАЯ ПРОСТОТА БЭМ?? Слышал про `bemtree`, но как его использовать? Я тут только городить иерархию научился. Это ещё сложнее будет, не зря ведь для более опытных оставляют!\r\n\r\nСверстать что-то только на BEMJSON, достаточно трудно. И тем более это отредактировать потом. Потом мне пришлось искать bemtree, т.к. это было единственным решением, которое я видел. И ОПА! Приплыли! Теперь нужно ещё deps файлы прописывать, а то сборка чёт не собирается.\r\n\r\nПочему бы не прививать bemtree сразу, если дело к нему идёт в конечном итоге? Человек уже на первых этапах будет знать,  что нужно для того, чтобы собирать проект. Не превращать его в монстра. А так получается, что пришёл из ~~чёрного~~ мира всяких jade, где люди писали код маленькими порциями и радовались жизни. Про BEMJSON достаточно только в документации рассказать, а работать нужно СРАЗУ с BEMTREE!\r\n\r\nНемного шрифт повысил, но я действительно вижу в этом большую проблему.

{"issue":"Feedback for \"Naming convention\"","body":"Hi,\r\n\r\nThese docs are an improvement, but the areas that need clarity are (I think I know the answers, but they need to be added to the docs):\r\n\r\n1. What happens when a component / block contains another component / block. How does the classing interact. Is there overlap? Can the child of one block be the root of another block? `header-button Button`\r\n\r\n2. Can a child also have a modifier? In your examples it is always the root element that has a modifier. Is this OK `block-name__elem-name_mod-name`. If this is not allowed, how should it be handled. For example a button with an icon vs a button with a large icon.\r\n\r\n3. How do you handle breakpoints? For example if you have a class of `sidebar_position_left` how do you position the element to the right at a breakpoint without leaving a class that is now incorrect on the element? Obviously hardcoding 'left' might be a bad idea, but the same could be true for any style added by a class that is overridden at a breakpoint.\r\n\r\n4. If you specialise a block, for example `data_table` vs `data-table_specialised` how do you then style elements. Is `data-table_specialised__element` correct? Or should you nest `data-table__specialized data_table__element`? This is a really important part of naming that I have almost never seen discussed.\r\n\r\nWith clarity on these kind of issues in the docs, I think peoples use of BEM naming would be much more consistent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","labels":[]}

{"issue":"Inconsistent calculation of \"remaining\" in timesheets","body":"When checking the timesheets with --warn-ts-deltas, there seem to be major inconsistencies with the attributes \"work\" and \"remaining\" when a resource is not working full time. Whereas work seems to be in units of man-days, \"remaining\":\r\n- when given in units of \"d\", is interpreted as resource-days\r\n- when given in units of \"h\", is converted into man-days but interpreted as resource days.\r\nFurthermore, calculating the remaining work seems wrong.\r\n\r\nThat definitely is a bit confusing, so here is an example: My resource \"jd\" is only working 4h per day\r\n```\r\nresource jd \"John Doe\" {    \r\n        rate 100.0         \r\n        limits { dailymax 4h }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nand there is one task to do:\r\n```\r\ntask t1 \"Task 1\" {  \r\n\teffort 4d # 4 man-days=32h => or 8 jd-days\r\n        allocate jd\r\n}\r\n```\r\nLet's assume I have received the following timesheet for a period of one week, where jd could work 20hours:\r\n```\r\ntimesheet jd 2016-03-14-01:00 - 2016-03-19-17:00 {\r\n  task t1 { \r\n    work 5d # jd has spent 5 weekdays on that \r\n    remaining 3d # remaining from jd's point of view: 3 weekdays => matches plan\r\n    status green \"ongoing\" {\r\n      summary \"everything as expected\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nConsequently, jd has worked 5/8 of the planned effort, and estimates that 3/8 are left. Running tj3 --warn-ts-deltas shows a warning:\r\n```\r\nWarning: John Doe requests less remaining effort for task t1\r\n3.0d instead of 4.0d\r\n```\r\nThat itself seems wrong. It gets worse, however, when units of hours are used:\r\n```\r\ntimesheet jd 2016-03-14-01:00 - 2016-03-19-17:00 {\r\n  task t1 { \r\n    work 20h\r\n    remaining 12h\r\n    status green \"ongoing\" {\r\n      summary \"everything as expected\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nOutput:\r\n```\r\nError: The total work to be reported for this time sheet is 5.0 days but only 2.5 days were reported.\r\n```\r\nSo this indicates that tj3 converts 20 hours into 2.5 man-days, and then ignores the fact that jd only works 4h/day. If all hours are doubled again, then we get the same than before.\r\n\r\nNow it gets really weird, if jd reports a new task:\r\n```\r\ntimesheet jd 2016-03-14-01:00 - 2016-03-19-17:00 {\r\n  task t1 { \r\n    work 20h\r\n    remaining 12h\r\n    status green \"ongoing\" {\r\n      summary \"everything as expected\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  newtask t2 \"Unexpected task\" {\r\n    work 20h\r\n    remaining 0h\r\n    status green \"new idea\" {\r\n      summary \"your schedule is broken now\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nBesides the fact that he cannot possibly have worked that much (consequence of the wrong conversion), the remaining effort is now incorrectly compared:\r\n```\r\nWarning: John Doe requests less remaining effort for task t1\r\n1.5d instead of 4.0d\r\nWarning: John Doe is requesting a new task:\r\n  ID: t2\r\n  Name: Unexpected task\r\n  Work: 2.5d  Remaining: 0.0d\r\n```\r\nIt now claims that 4d should be left (32hours? 16 hours?) and that jd only expects 1.5d (man-days).\r\n\r\nOf course, when mixing hours and days then all is lost.","labels":[]}

This can be reproduced with the following setup (figurative, mind the paths):\r\n 1. Start `tj3d`, no matter which directory\r\n 2. Add a project like this\r\n     ```bash\r\n\r\ncd ~\r\ntj3client add ~/projects/the-project/project.tjp\r\n     ```\r\n 3. Invoke the time sheet sender like this\r\n    ```bash\r\n\r\ntj3ts_sender -c ~/projects/the-project/project.tjrc -d ~/projects/the-project/\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will result in the above error.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this is: It seems that tj3d spawns a new process for each new project added with `tj3client add`. This tj3d subprocess' working directory equals the directory in which `tj3client add` was executed.\r\n\r\nThis behaviour is counterintuitive and fragile. The project's working directory should be set within a single location. \r\n\r\nA solutions to this could be:\r\n\r\nAdd a `-d` switch to `tj3client add` to set the project's output directory. If not set default to the path of the project's main `<project>.tjp`. Remove the `-d` option from `tj3ts_sender` and use the path provided during `tj3client add -d <dir> <project>.tjp`. This way the working directory is specified in a single location and remains consistent over all operations.\r\n\r\n## References\r\n * [Discussion on TaskJuggler Users](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/taskjuggler-users/7JyvNu_s6C8)","labels":[]}

{"issue":"tj3d issue and work-around","body":"I wouldn't call this a fix, but it made the issue (which seem to be somewhat common) go away.  The problem was my issue with tj3d.  I started with an absolutely fresh and up-to-date Fedora 21 installation (x86_64), taskjuggler installed via RPM which automatically installed ruby with YAML support. \r\n\r\n> Kernel: 3.19.3-200.fc21.x86_64\r\n> rubygem-taskjuggler-3.5.0-1.fc21\r\n> ruby-2.1.5-26.fc21.x86_64\r\n\r\n tj3 works like a charm. I use it HEAVILY.  Trying to start using the tj3d and tj3webd functionality to take it to the next level, I tried for the first time to bring up tj3d with a project I spend more time working on that I should.  That failed.  I it would get stuck trying to import the project.  So I grabbed the tutorial.tjp and tried loading that.   This attempt failed as well.  So I started exploring and found that many folks have experienced similar issues.  There were some suggestions regarding the confirmation of YAML support.  Those tests passed for me.\r\n```\r\n$ ruby -r yaml -e \"YAML::load_file('.taskjugglerrc')\"\r\n$ echo $?\r\n0\r\n```\r\nSo I attempted to throw tj3d into heavy debugging mode:\r\n`tj3d -d -w --debug  -p 12345 -c .taskjugglerrc  tutorial.tjp`\r\nI chose a crazy port that wasn't default so it would be easier to spot in the log files\r\nThe .taskjugglerrc was straight from the tutorial (just one level higher on the debugging):\r\n```\r\n$ cat .taskjugglerrc \r\n_global:\r\n  authKey: topsecret\r\n  webServerPort: 8080\r\n  _log:\r\n    logLevel: 4\r\n    outputLevel: 4\r\n```\r\nHere is the stderr log file created during my last failed run:\r\n```\r\n$ cat tj3d.ps.2196.stderr\r\nException `SecurityError' at /usr/share/gems/gems/taskjuggler-3.5.0/lib/taskjuggler/TjTime.rb:79 - Insecure operation - []=\r\nException `SecurityError' at /usr/share/gems/gems/taskjuggler-3.5.0/lib/taskjuggler/daemon/ProjectServer.rb:113 - Insecure operation - []=\r\nException `RuntimeError' at /usr/share/gems/gems/taskjuggler-3.5.0/lib/taskjuggler/MessageHandler.rb:300 - RuntimeError\r\n/usr/share/gems/gems/taskjuggler-3.5.0/lib/taskjuggler/MessageHandler.rb:300:in `addMessage': RuntimeError (RuntimeError)\r\n        from /usr/share/gems/gems/taskjuggler-3.5.0/lib/taskjuggler/MessageHandler.rb:189:in `fatal'\r\n        from /usr/share/gems/gems/taskjuggler-3.5.0/lib/taskjuggler/MessageHandler.rb:311:in `fatal'\r\n        from /usr/share/gems/gems/taskjuggler-3.5.0/lib/taskjuggler/Tj3AppBase.rb:160:in `rescue in main'\r\n        from /usr/share/gems/gems/taskjuggler-3.5.0/lib/taskjuggler/Tj3AppBase.rb:126:in `main'\r\n        from /usr/share/gems/gems/taskjuggler-3.5.0/lib/tj3d.rb:15:in `<top (required)>'\r\n        from /usr/share/rubygems/rubygems/core_ext/kernel_require.rb:55:in `require'\r\n        from /usr/share/rubygems/rubygems/core_ext/kernel_require.rb:55:in `require'\r\n        from /usr/share/gems/gems/taskjuggler-3.5.0/bin/tj3d:4:in `<top (required)>'\r\n        from /bin/tj3d:23:in `load'\r\n        from /bin/tj3d:23:in `<main>'\r\nFatal: Insecure operation - []=\r\n/usr/share/gems/gems/taskjuggler-3.5.0/lib/taskjuggler/TjTime.rb:79:in `[]='\r\n/usr/share/gems/gems/taskjuggler-3.5.0/lib/taskjuggler/TjTime.rb:79:in `checkTimeZone'\r\n/usr/share/gems/gems/taskjuggler-3.5.0/lib/taskjuggler/TjpSyntaxRules.rb:7342:in `block in rule_validTimeZone'\r\n/usr/share/gems/gems/taskjuggler-3.5.0/lib/taskjuggler/TextParser.rb:393:in `call'\r\n/usr/share/gems/gems/taskjuggler-3.5.0/lib/taskjuggler/TextParser.rb:393:in `finishPattern'\r\n/usr/share/gems/gems/taskjuggler-3.5.0/lib/taskjuggler/TextParser.rb:345:in `block in parseFSM'\r\n/usr/share/gems/gems/taskjuggler-3.5.0/lib/taskjuggler/TextParser.rb:271:in `loop'\r\n/usr/share/gems/gems/taskjuggler-3.5.0/lib/taskjuggler/TextParser.rb:271:in `parseFSM'\r\n/usr/share/gems/gems/taskjuggler-3.5.0/lib/taskjuggler/TextParser.rb:200:in `parse'\r\n/usr/share/gems/gems/taskjuggler-3.5.0/lib/taskjuggler/TaskJuggler.rb:66:in `block in parse'\r\n/usr/share/gems/gems/taskjuggler-3.5.0/lib/taskjuggler/TaskJuggler.rb:54:in `each'\r\n/usr/share/gems/gems/taskjuggler-3.5.0/lib/taskjuggler/TaskJuggler.rb:54:in `parse'\r\n/usr/share/gems/gems/taskjuggler-3.5.0/lib/taskjuggler/daemon/ProjectServer.rb:154:in `loadProject'\r\n/usr/share/gems/gems/taskjuggler-3.5.0/lib/taskjuggler/daemon/ProjectServer.rb:290:in `block (2 levels) in startHousekeeping'\r\n/usr/share/gems/gems/taskjuggler-3.5.0/lib/taskjuggler/daemon/ProjectServer.rb:283:in `loop'\r\n/usr/share/gems/gems/taskjuggler-3.5.0/lib/taskjuggler/daemon/ProjectServer.rb:283:in `block in startHousekeeping'\r\n\r\n*******************************************************************************\r\nYou have triggered a bug in TaskJuggler version 3.5.0!\r\nPlease see the user manual on how to get this bug fixed!\r\nhttp://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/Reporting_Bugs.html#Reporting_Bugs_and_Feature_Requests\r\n*******************************************************************************\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, I went exploring the TjTime.rb file mentioned in the log file above.

I set and exported a TZ environment variable and achieved the same results as before - failure.   Looking closer at the stderr output I found this line and did a little more research about setting SAFE in ruby.\r\n`Fatal: Insecure operation - []=`\r\nNot knowing anything about anything, I then commented out line 79.  That's it.  Just commented it out.  I unset the previously set TZ environment variable.\r\n\r\nThe who.le show works now.  All tutorial examples work.  My large project file works with all of it's crazy includes and booking statement files.  The web interface works.  I am running the very simple .taskjugglerrc file as above and can run tj3d and tj3webd without any arguments - like I said straight from the tutorial.\r\n\r\nThis is just a fantastic project and want to help in any way I can.  I wouldn't call this a fix, but it now causes everything that I know to try from the tutorial --- to work.  Maybe this will help others.\r\n\r\nPlease use the suggestion to alter TjTime.rb at your own risk.

{"issue":"[Feature request] sum duration of a set of tasks for time-dependent repeating tasks","body":"Horrible name... but I'm using tj to plan some time-sensitive experiments which have a set of steps that need to occur at the same intervals for repeatability.

Sorry I can't go into more detail... work-related stuff. Think of it as chemistry related. Combining A + B in one step begins a reaction that starts changing properties. I want the same amount of time to occur between the combination and testing for Batch 2 so that I can isolate the effect of step 3 by comparing the results.\r\n\r\nHopefully that made sense. This is a combo feature request + request for any tips on doing this if it already exists.

{"issue":"Vacations / leaves and workinghours - consistency problem","body":"Hi, \r\n\r\nI found something very illogical in the way tj3 handles vacations/leaves and working hours. The problem may be in the interval3 third format (+duration)\r\n\r\nExample (sorry I tried to use the < code > thing but it failed) :\r\n\r\n\r\nproject test \"TEST\"  2014-07-16 +2m {\r\n  \ttimezone \"Europe/Paris\"\r\n  \ttimeformat \"%Y-%m-%d\"\r\n  \tdailyworkinghours 7\r\n  \tworkinghours mon - fri 9:00 - 12:00, 14:00 - 18:00\r\n  \tworkinghours sat, sun off\r\n}  \r\n\r\nresource user1 \"User 1\" {\r\n\tleaves holiday 2014-07-21 +10d\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nMy collegue, user1, told me he was taking 10days of vacations, starting 2014-07-21, the logic would be to set his holidays as I did in the example. But it's all wrong because when my collegue took 10 days he was obvioulsy not counting the non working hours AKA saturday and sunday !!\r\n\r\nOne of the magical thing with a format like startdate +duration is that you don't care about calculating the end date. With tj3, you have to calculate the enddate then substract with the startdate, then put the number as a duration. There is no magic at all and the start +duration is totally useless ! And don't tell me that we should speak in real days instead of working days.

","labels":[]}
{"issue":"site-wide enhancements to info display & new features","body":"Big-picture list of enhancements for volunteers to tackle - on our open-source, non-profit platform! \r\n\r\nBriefest background: AskThem was conceived primarily as a \"We the People\" for every U.S. elected official, and secondarily for public figures with verified Twitter accounts. Stakeholder research showed that verifying a question-asker as a constituent was usually necessary to solicit a response, so UI put visitors through an address-or-ZIP-lookup funnel before asking a question. Data limitations on elected official info played a role in what we were able to develop with tech lead @walter, who's been incredible. \r\n\r\nGoals below are towards making it easier for new visitors to find their question target and publish through a question, outside of the address-lookup funnel - relevant for user stories around, say, the Presidential debates and major Twitter accounts.\r\n\r\n1. On homepage, sitewide search for question recipients by name. If selected, go to question-asking [page](http://www.askthem.io/ny-new-york/questions/new?person=52e3e3b6f92ea1272b000011), or see 2 below, if a question-field on that page is possible. If elected official w/ frequent name, they may require disambiguation. If a Twitter target in database, go to AskThem page; If Twitter target not already in database, ideally app would add that question recipient, as it does now from question-asking process.  \r\n\r\n2. On question recipient pages, display a text box for 100 character questions to that entity, which then after entered flips to an email entry field. Question would display immediately but be nuked within 24 hours or less if email address isn't verified. Follow-up email from app would need to direct email recipient to /users/sign_up to complete registration. Optional, sign-in buttons with FB & Twitter & G+.\r\n\r\n3. Currently, elected official data is populated by a variety of API calls - hence, elected pages are in three tabs, for federal and state and city. Goal is to display all available elected officials in a state, e.g. WI, on a page, so visitors can find their target by scrolling to name. If a major U.S. city doesn't have municipal electeds, goal is to offer a link to a process to submit them to our data partners. \r\n\r\n4. Easier UI for asking electeds to become AskThem verified, free of charge. \r\n\r\n5. Dynamic signature thresholds, tied to population of relevant jurisdiction - a stretch goal, with some data analysis components. \r\n\r\n6. SEO enhancements for state legislator names, pegged to Google Analytics results. \r\n\r\nInput welcome on above priorities. ","labels":[]}

{"issue":"widget design enhancements - seeking volunteer time on useful new tools","body":"Our non-profit AskThem project was fortunate to develop free question-asking widgets with the Knight Foundation Prototype Fund. \r\n\r\nWe had the goal of enabling visitors to ask a question through to AskThem from any participating web page, while staying on that web page. After rounds of digital-media research and user testing, we found that many users sought to ask questions to the authors of articles and celebrities mentioned in posts (often more so than their own elected officials).\r\n\r\nOur tech lead @walter developed two kinds of widgets, created by a free [widget-builder](http://www.askthem.io/widgets/builder), which generates embeddable Javascript widget code for any web page. \r\n\r\nThe first is a Person widget - see [example](http://blog.askthem.io/blog/2015/08/06/ask-questions-to-2016-presidential-candidates/) - where the creator of the widget selects a specific question target: any elected official in our database, or any non-private Twitter account (does not need to be Twitter-verified with a blue check). The visitor can click through and ask her own question, or edit a pre-written default question set by the widget creator. Resulting questions also go through to the AskThem.io site for social sharing. \r\n\r\nThe second is an Address widget - see [example](http://blog.askthem.io/blog/2015/04/09/askthem-widgets-test-page/) - where a visitor enters her ZIP code or full street address, then sees her elected officials: definitely federal, almost always state, and sometimes city-level (depending on full address info). \r\n\r\nGoal is to enhance the design of the widget windows themselves- open to input, some starting points: \r\n\r\n1. On a page with an embedded widget, when visitor clicks the \"get started\" button to launch the modal, resulting window is a bit thin and large. Tightening up the design and solidifying the edges might be more appealing. \r\n\r\n2. I could use more examples of good widget design, but a tighter version (albeit one that requires less text space for visitors to input question content) is by our siblings Fight For the Future, at [BattleForTheNet](https://www.battleforthenet.com/). Code on [GitHub](https://github.com/fightforthefuture/battleforthenet-widget).\r\n\r\n3. Widget-builder page itself could then use some sample images, but that's straightforward. \r\n\r\nHelp our open-source, public-benefit project with some volunteer design time? Your work could be used on major media sites for Q&A with Presidential candidates, participating city council offices, and more public figures such as the blog of Chris Hayes on MSNBC. Email me, david at ppolitics dot org, or ping me on Skype, handle is davidmooreppf, or on Freenode in IRC, where I hang out in #opengovernment.

{"issue":"Implement Data Mapper pattern instead of Active Record","body":"Opening this issue to discuss how the Model layer is going to be implemented.\r\n\r\nI propose we implement the Data Mapper [1] pattern instead of the currently planned Active Record pattern. I say this because that while the Active Record pattern may be easy at first and faster to implement, it violates the single responsibility principle in that it concerns itself with both domain logic and persistence [2]. Also as Titon is a framework, it needs to be as flexible as possible so decoupling is key.\r\n\r\nTo go along with the Data Mapper pattern, there is also usually a service layer. All this service layer does is marry domain objects to their data mappers and are the end-user interface. You would then use a service in, say, the controller layer [3].\r\n\r\nThis whole pattern adds extra complexity through layers of abstraction, but it is much more extensible and testable.

This mostly happens in the Boost.Build repo, where we have, e.g., `/tags/jam/`<whatever> and `/tags/tools/jam/<whatever>`.  It seems likely that these tags were all simply moved/re-rooted... ah, yes, see [r39733](http://ci.boost.org/svn-trac/changeset/39733).

{"issue":"Make backup hook command semantics well-defined","body":"Tim's documentation request made me think about this.  These sorts of changes would be introduced in a major version bump rather than 1.0.X.\r\n\r\nThere's a few issues with backup-commands:\r\n\r\n - after-backup-command only runs on successful backups.  This should have probably been called 'successful-backup-command' or something along those lines\r\n - backup commands don't consistently have access to the configuration.  before-backup-command is currently run before a backup.conf exists, and it's ugly to extract things from an ini config anyway\r\n - backup commands inherit the environment of holland itself, which can change depending on how its run (i.e. $PWD is pretty useless to rely on).\r\n\r\nThere really should be four stages of hook commands:\r\n\r\n  - before-backup -> run after local backup directory and config is available but before plugin is called\r\n  - failed-backup-command -> run if a backup fails\r\n  - successful-backup-command -> run only if a backup succeeds\r\n  - after-backup -> unconditionally run after the backup regardless of failure (unless holland is terminated with prejudice)\r\n\r\nI think the environment should be setup more consistently.  Some environment variables I think might be useful offhand:\r\n\r\n - HOLLAND_BACKUP_DIRECTORY (i.e. /var/spool/holland/$name/YYMMdd_HHMMSS/)\r\n - HOLLAND_BACKUPSET (i.e. 'default')\r\n - HOLLAND_BACKUP_CONFIG -> I think a json encoded blob of the (validated) python dict config may make sense here so a backup command can do something useful with it.\r\n - HOLLAND_BACKUP_EVENT -> {before,after,failed,successful}-backup\r\n\r\nThese basically map to the template variables holland 1.0.x documents today ($backupdir, $hook, $backupset).  I imagine other information might make sense here as well (HOLLAND_VERSION, etc.).\r\n\r\nAdditionally I think holland should run these commands with cwd = ${backupdir} by default, rather than just relative to whatever cwd holland was started with.  That makes it easy if the purpose it to change some file in the backup directory (i.e. ```touch my_status_file``` vs. ```touch $backupdir/my_status_file```)\r\n\r\nPerhaps other sanitizing of the environment makes sense here too.","labels":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/holland-backup/holland/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb"}]}

I propose just adding a stop-slave option for this to the LVM plugin.\r\n\r\nAs a side note, this same issue exists in some configurations with Percona-Server 5.6.20 and below when using Percona's backup locks feature.  This was recently fixed in 5.6.21.  Holland doesn't support backup locks yet but it should for at least the LVM plugins.","labels":[]}
{"issue":"Implement backup file checksums","body":"There have been a few occasions where backup data has been corrupted after the fact, usually after shuffling through various long-term storage services.  Sometimes those use deduplication features or other complex transformations that don't always interact well with all file formats.  It is often difficult to tell where the corruption was introduced - whether holland did something wrong, or the source data was already bad or bit rot was introduced during shuffling data around.\r\n\r\nTo combat this, I would like to see checksums (optionally) generated after a successful backup so backup files can be easily verified later.  This is relatively cheap to calculate even for large backups and can be disabled if problematic.\r\n\r\nI propose one new option to support this feature:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[holland:backup]\r\nchecksum-algorithm = option(none, md5, sha1, sha256, ..., default=\"md5\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere \"none\" disables the feature entirely.  md5 is going to be the fastest and probably good enough here, but perhaps holland should default to one of the more robust sha variants.\r\n\r\nThis feature should write a CHECKSUMS file to the backup directory after successful backup by a plugin.  Paths should be relative to the backup directory so one can simply verify via:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd path\r\n$ md5sum -c < CHECKSUMS\r\n```","labels":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/holland-backup/holland/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb"}]}
{"issue":"Deprecate estimating backup sizes","body":"I think holland should give up on trying to estimate backup sizes.  It's a hard problem to do this accurately in the face of compression or other transformations and it can be expensive to calculate.  This complicates the code in non-trivial ways in various places as well\r\n\r\nI do think some guard to avoid exhausting disk space is important - particularly when backup space is shared with some other critical resource (often the database being backed up).  I think instead of estimation, some basic disk space monitoring should be done.  So rather than aborting if we expect a backup to be too large, holland should rather abort only if disk space falls too low.  This is fairly simple to do with a background thread that just sits in a loop polling statvfs(2) periodically and signaling holland to abort when this falls below some threshold.\r\n\r\nI propose three new configuration options to support this with the following tentative naming conventions and default values:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[holland:backup]\r\ndisk-space-monitor = boolean(default=yes)   # flag to enable/disable monitoring disk space\r\ndisk-space-monitor-required-space = filesize(default=\"5G\")  # If the space falls below this threshold, abort\r\ndisk-space-monitor-interval = float(default=1.0) # interval in seconds between checks\r\n```\r\n\r\nRequired space will be compared against available space based on statvfs(2) of the backup directory's mountpoint - the same mechanism holland currently uses to compare estimated space vs. space available.\r\n\r\nAs far as signaling holland, I think sending a process the signal SIGUSR1 to force and abort makes sense for now.  This works on environments where holland is currently supported.  Holland can install an appropriate signal handler to fail gracefully in this case.","labels":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/holland-backup/holland/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb"}]}
{"issue":"Job IDs in logs","body":"Feature request - Sometimes it takes so long to backup MySQL data that the first backup is still running when the next fires off.  When this happens, the logs become cluttered with multiple start and stop messages in the middle of the log output from the original backup that's still running.  This makes it very difficult to pull all the logs from just that one job that ran for 30 hours.\r\n\r\nA solution would be to include a job ID on every log entry in the holland log.  We could then simply grep for that job ID to get all logs relevant to that single run, without all the clutter of other jobs trying to run.","labels":[]}

{"issue":"Support for 'private' operationalmode?","body":"Hi,\r\n\r\nwe have a few parties developing systems to work with or using Oxalis, and some of them do not have PEPPOL (test) certificates yet, or may not have them at all (since they will not be running the access points themselves as a third party). In order to improve the interoperability testing in an early phase it would be very nice to be able to test with a local PKI in a group that has short lines and quick communication.\r\n\r\nI have a patch in my fork that adds a third operational mode 'PRIVATE'; this enables a configuration option oxalis.truststore where a local truststore can be set apart from the existing production and test truststores. It can be found in https://github.com/tjeb/oxalis/tree/private_truststore\r\n\r\nWould you consider that a useful addition in the mainline? If so, I can make a pull request; the current branch is based on tag oxalis-3.2.0 which is what we are running, but I could clean it up and base it on master as well.

And I'm a c# developer, so don't know to much about Java code styling.\r\n\r\nPlease look at the class eu.peppol.smp.SmpLookupManagerImpl in the method getEndpointType listed below.\r\n\r\n    private EndpointType getEndpointType(ParticipantId participant, PeppolDocumentTypeId documentTypeIdentifier) {\r\n        try {\r\n            SignedServiceMetadataType serviceMetadata = getServiceMetaData(participant, documentTypeIdentifier);\r\n            return selectOptimalEndpoint(serviceMetadata);\r\n        } catch (Exception e) {\r\n            throw new RuntimeException(\"Problem with SMP lookup\", e);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nEvery time the SML/SMP lookups fails, a new RuntimeException with the message \"Problem with SMP lookup\" is return.

I then have to switch over all the different exception type, that must be handle - that is exactly what a a try-catch perform for me.\r\nThere must be a switch case of type SmpSignedServiceMetaDataException, before I know it is a SMP problem, but then I know what to do, and how to report back.\r\n\r\nFrom my point of view, the current try-catch design is not good, and not the way to implement exception handler.\r\n\r\nI can see that there are multiple concrete exceptions implemented in Oxalis (SmpLookupException, ParticipantNotRegisteredException, ...), but if they anyway are  wrapped in a RuntimeException, what are they then used for?\r\n\r\nJacob Mogensen","labels":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/difi/oxalis/labels/minor%20bug","name":"minor bug","color":"fbca04"}]}

{"issue":"EHF Question concerning negative amounts using prepaid amount element","body":"Hi Difi,\r\n\r\nWe've received a file which had a LegalMonetaryTotal and TaxTotal structure like below exemplified. The issue we had was that the PrepaidAmount contained a negative amount. As far as we can find in the specification only RoundingAmount could contain a negative amount (not taking into account the quantity elements). \r\nHowever I could not find any information regarding PrepaidAmount being negative.\r\n\r\nIn our case, the negative PrepaidAmount was actually a fee to be paid (a fee from the previous invoice which was not paid), the calculation in schematron will give correct result since PrepaidAmount is always deducted from the amount to be paid (PayableAmount). \r\nHowever, we would interpret PrepaidAmount to only be used when you have an actual PrepaidAmount to present i.e an amount that should be deducted from the payment and not added.
